# django-commerce

Implementation of CS50's [project 2 (Commerce)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/).

This Django project aims to design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”
